## Bank Churning Factors
**Goal:** To provide actionable insights and recommendations to mitigate customer churn.

**Description:** The project focused on identifying and visualizing key factors contributing to bank churners. To begin the project, I collected and analyzed a comprehensive dataset that contained various customer attributes and churn information. The dataset encompassed factors such as demographics, account types, and customer churn status.

Firstly, I developed interactive dashboards that showcased key metrics and trends related to customer churn. These dashboards enabled me to analyze the overall churn rate, identify churn patterns over time, and gain a comprehensive view of the customer churn landscape.

Next, I employed various visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and heat maps, to explore the relationship between customer attributes and churn. By visualizing customer demographics, account types, transaction patterns, and customer interactions, I sought to identify any significant correlations or patterns that could shed light on the factors influencing churn.

Additionally, I utilized Tableau's advanced features, including filters, parameters, and drill-down capabilities, to delve deeper into the data. This allowed me to conduct detailed exploratory analysis and investigate potential factors at a granular level.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, dashboard creation, data mining, statistical analysis.

**Technology:** Tableau

**Results:** The most prominent time to churn is at 36 months. The credit card category indicates those with no annual fees are more likely to have bank chruners sign on then cancel after getting the rewards.
The result of this project was a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to bank churners, gained through data analysis and visualization. They key outcomes and results achieved include:
1. Identification of Key Churn Factors: Through the analysis and visualiztion of customer data, I successfully identified the signififcant factors that contribute to bank churn. These factors include account types and customer interactions. The factor of credit card type indicates those with no annual fees are more likely to have churners sign on then cancel after getting the rewards.

2. Actionable Insights and Recommendations: The project resulted in actionable insights and recommendations to mitigate customer churn. By analyzing the identified churn factors, I provided valuable information for the bank to develop targeted strategies and interventions. These recommendations may include personalized customer retention campaigns, improved customer support initiatives, or product enhancements based on the identified factors.

3. Enhanced Customer Retention Strategies: Armed with the knowledge of influential churn factors, the bank can develop and refine their customer retention strategies. By focusing on the identified factors, they can prioritize efforts and resources on retaining customers who are most at risk of churning, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.
