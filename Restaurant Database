## Restaurant Database
**Goal:** To design and implement a functional database system for a restaurant to ensure .

**Description:** The database I developed encompassed various entities and relationships, enabling seamless management of restaurant operations. The core entities included customers, employees, suppliers, orders, and recipes. 

For customers, I designed a schema that encompassed essential information such as names, contact details, and preferences. This allowed for personalized service and streamlined communication with customers.

In regards to employees, I developed a system that stored employee profiles, including their roles, contact information, and work schedules. The database also incorporated delivery drivers, allowing the restaurant to efficiently manage deliveries. This enabled the restaurant management to better assign tasks and manage shifts.

Suppliers played a vital role in the restaurant's supply chain, and I incorporated their information into the database. This allowed the restaurant to maintain a record of suppliers, their contact details, and the ingredients they provided.

The ordering system was an integral part of the database, allowing the restaurant to process and track orders. By implementing order history functionality, the database kept a comprehensive record of past orders, facilitating analysis and tracking customer preferences.

The inclusion of menu items and ingredients allowed the restaurant to manage its menu effectively. The database stored information about recipes and the quantity of each ingredient used, while menu items detailed the names and prices. This streamlined menu management and enhanced the overall functionality of the restaurant's menu offerings.

Lastly, to address allergy concerns, I integrated allergy information into the database. This allowed the restaurant staff to quickly identify allergens present in each dish, providing valuable information for customers and ensuring their safety.
