## Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
**Goal:** Develop a predictive model that could estimate the rating customers would likely assign to a movie they hadn't watched.

**Description:** To begin the project, I collected a dataset about movies, such as genre, cast, director, plot summary, and other relevant attributes. Additionally, I gathered customer reviews and ratings for a set of movies to serve as labeled data for model training and evaluation.

I utilized data preparation tools to clean and transform the movie and review data into a suitable format for analysis. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical attributes.

I employed feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant attributes that could contribute to predicting customer sentiment. This involved analyzing the correlation between attributes and the target variable, applying statistical tests, or using machine learning algorithms for feature importance ranking.

I trained machine learning algorithms available in RapinMiner, such as support vector machines, on the labeled movie review data. I split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' performance and select the best-performing algorithm.

Using the trained model, I made predictions on the unseen movies by feeding their attributes as input. RapidMiner allowed me to generate predicted ratings for these movies, which I then evaluated against actual customer reviews to assess the model's predictive performance.

**Skills:** data preprocessing, feature selection, machine learning, model training and evaluation, predictive analytics

**Technology:** RapidMiner

**Results:** The result of this project was the successful development of a predictive model using RapidMiner to estimate customer reviews for unseen movies. The key outcomes and results achieved include:
1. Predictive Model: Creation of a robust and accurate predictive model capable of estimating customer sentiment for movies that customers had not watched yet. The model was trained using machine learning algorithms and evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure its reliability and performance.

2. Decision Support: Provided decision support for movie studios, streaming platforms, and marketers. The predictive model enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding movie releases, marketing campaigns, or investment decisions based on anticipated customer sentiment and ratings.

3. Improved Decision-Making: Contributed to enhanced decision-making processes within the movie industry. By incorporating data-driven insights into the decision-making process, stakeholders were empowered to align their strategies with customer preferences and market trends, leading to more informed and effective decisions.

4. Competitive Advantage: The project's outcome provides a competitive advantage for movie studios or streaming platforms. Anticipating customer sentiment and ratings for unseen movies allows stakeholders to differentiate themselves by offering content tailored to customer preferences, resulting in increased customer engagement and loyalty.
