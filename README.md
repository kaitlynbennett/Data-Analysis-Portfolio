## About
Hi, I'm Kaitlyn! I have completed my BS degree with a major in Business Management and a minor in Management Information Systems, which has allowed me to acquire a strong foundation in business principles, management skills, strategic thinking, and technology integration. By combining my skills in data analysis with my passion for promoting diversity and inclusion, I strive to make a tangible difference in the representation of women in technology. 

During my studies, I honed the ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. A degree in business management has provided me with a solid understanding of various functional areas within an organization, such as marketing, finance, operations, and human resources. This knowledge allows me to contextualize data within the business environment, identify relevant metrics, and generate insights that align with the organizational goals. My minor has equipped me with a diverse set of technical skills, including proficiency in tools such as; Excel, Access, SQL, Tableau, Gephi and RapidMiner.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills, demonstrating my ability to tackle complex business challenges and deliver actionable insights. I have also included examples of my work in data mining and statistics. These projects showcase my ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets, and combining data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

This repository is to showcase my skills, share projects and track progress in Data Analytics related topics.
