## Bank Churning Factors
**Code:**

**Goal:** To provide actionable insights and recommendations to mitigate customer churn.

**Description:** The project focused on identifying and visualizing key factors contributing to bank churners. To begin the project, I collected and analyzed a comprehensive dataset that contained various customer attributes and churn information. The dataset encompassed factors such as demographics, account types, and customer churn status.

Firstly, I developed interactive dashboards that showcased key metrics and trends related to customer churn. These dashboards enabled me to analyze the overall churn rate, identify churn patterns over time, and gain a comprehensive view of the customer churn landscape.

Next, I employed various visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and heat maps, to explore the relationship between customer attributes and churn. By visualizing customer demographics, account types, transaction patterns, and customer interactions, I sought to identify any significant correlations or patterns that could shed light on the factors influencing churn.

Additionally, I utilized Tableau's advanced features, including filters, parameters, and drill-down capabilities, to delve deeper into the data. This allowed me to conduct detailed exploratory analysis and investigate potential factors at a granular level.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, dashboard creation, data mining, statistical analysis.

**Technology:** Tableau

**Results:** The most prominent time to churn is at 36 months. The credit card category indicates those with no annual fees are more likely to have bank chruners sign on then cancel after getting the rewards.
The result of this project was a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to bank churners, gained through data analysis and visualization. They key outcomes and results achieved include:
1. Identification of Key Churn Factors: Through the analysis and visualiztion of customer data, I successfully identified the signififcant factors that contribute to bank churn. These factors include account types and customer interactions. The factor of credit card type indicates those with no annual fees are more likely to have churners sign on then cancel after getting the rewards.

2. Actionable Insights and Recommendations: The project resulted in actionable insights and recommendations to mitigate customer churn. By analyzing the identified churn factors, I provided valuable information for the bank to develop targeted strategies and interventions. These recommendations may include personalized customer retention campaigns, improved customer support initiatives, or product enhancements based on the identified factors.

3. Enhanced Customer Retention Strategies: Armed with the knowledge of influential churn factors, the bank can develop and refine their customer retention strategies. By focusing on the identified factors, they can prioritize efforts and resources on retaining customers who are most at risk of churning, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.



## Restaurant Database
**Code:**

**Goal:** To design and implement a functional database system for a restaurant to ensure .

**Description:** The database I developed encompassed various entities and relationships, enabling seamless management of restaurant operations. The core entities included customers, employees, suppliers, orders, and recipes. 

For customers, I designed a schema that encompassed essential information such as names, contact details, and preferences. This allowed for personalized service and streamlined communication with customers.

In regards to employees, I developed a system that stored employee profiles, including their roles, contact information, and work schedules. The database also incorporated delivery drivers, allowing the restaurant to efficiently manage deliveries. This enabled the restaurant management to better assign tasks and manage shifts.

Suppliers played a vital role in the restaurant's supply chain, and I incorporated their information into the database. This allowed the restaurant to maintain a record of suppliers, their contact details, and the ingredients they provided.

The ordering system was an integral part of the database, allowing the restaurant to process and track orders. By implementing order history functionality, the database kept a comprehensive record of past orders, facilitating analysis and tracking customer preferences.

The inclusion of menu items and ingredients allowed the restaurant to manage its menu effectively. The database stored information about recipes and the quantity of each ingredient used, while menu items detailed the names and prices. This streamlined menu management and enhanced the overall functionality of the restaurant's menu offerings.

Lastly, to address allergy concerns, I integrated allergy information into the database. This allowed the restaurant staff to quickly identify allergens present in each dish, providing valuable information for customers and ensuring their safety.

**Skills:** database design, data modeling, data management, data analysis, ER diagram, normalization techniques

**Technology:** SQL

**Results:** The result of this project was the successful implementation of a robust and efficient database system for the restaurant. They key outcomes and benefits achieved include:
1. Improved Data Management: Databse provided a centralized and well-structured platform for storing and managing various entities. This ensured easier access, retrieval, and manipulation of data, enhancing overall data management efficiency.
   
2. Streamlined Operations: The implemented database system streamlined various restaurant operations, including order processing, inventory management, customer management, and menu planning. This reduced manual efforts and increased operational efficiency.
   
3. Accurate Inventory Tracking: With the inclusion of ingredients and recipes, the database facilitated precise inventory tracking. This ensured better control over ingredient quantities, reduced waste, and improved inventory management.
   
4. Scalability and Future Growth:The database considered scalability, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation as the restaurant grows. It provided a foundation for future enhancements and integration with additional systems or technologies.
  
5. Data Analysis and Insights: The system enabled the extraction of valuable insights through data analysis. This included identifying popular dishes, tracking customer preferences, analyzing sales patterns, and generating reports. These insights supported informed decision-making and helped optimize business strategies.
